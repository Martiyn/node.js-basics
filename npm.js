// NPM or Node Package Manager is a part of node that is essential to programming
// With NPM we are able to install or uninstall and update the different packages or dependencies in our application
// Using some pretty straightforward commands IN THE CONSOLE we can use NPM
// Things that we can do with NPM include installing libraries, frameworks and other things to the application
// NOTE it is impossible to use NPM unless you type the command IN THE CONSOLE
// That being said let's say we want to add bootstrap to our app
// It would be done like so:

// IN THE CONSOLE: npm install bootstrap

// Now with this command NPM will begin installing bootstrap to your app
// Once it is done you can check which version of bootstrap you have in the "package.json" file under dependencies
// As you can imagine NPM is lifechanging when creating an app as it gives you complete freedom with how you can go about it

// Now there are those cases where you want to remove a package or library
// NPM once again has this covered with another very simple command
// Again it must be typed in the console or it will simply not work 
// Let's say we want to remove bootstrap 
// We would go about it like so:

// IN THE CONSOLE: npm uninstall bootstrap

// As you can see it is pretty straightforward and easy to work with NPM
// It is even possible to install a github repository using npm although it's not recommended
// Anyhow if you want to do it it would be like so:

// IN THE CONSOLE: npm install (repository link)

// And it is all set

// Something very interesting to note is that with NPM you can bootstrap an app using a framework like React.js
// It is extremely useful as you can begin working on your React app right away
// It is done like so:

// IN THE CONSOLE: npx create-react-app my-app

// Notice how this time we use NPX instead of NPM and then we follow up with create-react-app
// This is the command we use to initialize the creation of the react app we want
// The "my-app" part is the name of the application
// The name can be set to anything we want but for the sake of these notes we named it something simple
// This is extremely benefitial as it pretty much creates for you a complete React application in which you can insert your own code
// Having this tool at your disposal makes the use of a front-end library like React much more convenient
